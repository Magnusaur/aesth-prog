# A New Throbber
This week (or last week, actually) was all about time, temporality and everything in between. Which isn't much. We were tasked with creating a new throbber, and so I did. [Check a look!](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Magnusaur/aesth-prog/9632f5a5/mini_ex/mini_ex3/p5/empty-example/index.html) Watch in horror as an anxious throbber-esque entity is torn apart in a deadly data-game of tug-of-war! Click either button to help the throbber on its way - left or right; heaven or hell!

Please note that the script will run immediately. I wanted there to be some kind of 'play' button, but was unable to properly implement one.

## Building a Better Mousetrap
I quite like the current type of throbbers, for its circular and hypnotic qualities. I wanted to create something that was still circular (or at least oval-shaped), yet also expressed the erratic and mystifying nature of behind-the-scenes processes. I had previously experimented with creating shapes with fluctuating variables. I like the idea of procedurally generated geometry. So I went about creating the spastic throbber. None of that took very long to create, so I decided to create some sort of artificial environment to simulate the throbber's role and use. At first I had the background be continually drawn, but I ultimately decided against it. I wanted the throbber to create a dynamic 'trail of processing'. One that is bewildering, yet strangely pleasing to look at. In terms of programming the whole thing, this project wasn't terribly difficult to pull off, yet it highlighted a lot of questions and (potential) issues I have. It certainly assured me of the importance of learning more about objects, different frames and possible limits to the draw function. 

## Tempus Fuckit
The throbber is an interesting component in the grand scheme of things. It's circular, mesmerizing, and seemingly without end. It conceptualizes time as circular, yet whenever it finishes its job (of 'entertaining' the user, as a place-holder for the actual content) it abruptly disappears. No goodbyes or conclusions. I wanted to create something that was not merely circular, but also able to express the individual and highly technical details facilitating, say, video streaming. So I created something erratic and tug-of-war-like in its nature. I created two variables that can be altered, respectively, but clicking one of the buttons. This was partially inspired by the recent debate regarding Net Neutrality, internet throttling, and the potential for 'streaming microtransactions', where the user can quickly pay a small amount of money to help along his or her current internet-based activity.
