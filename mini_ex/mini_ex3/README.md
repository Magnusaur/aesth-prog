# A New Throbber
This week (or last week, actually) was all about time, temporality and everything in between. Which isn't much. We were tasked with creating a new throbber, and so I did. [Check a look!](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Magnusaur/aesth-prog/9632f5a5/mini_ex/mini_ex3/p5/empty-example/index.html) Please note that the script will run immediately. I wanted there to be some kind of 'play' button, but was unable to properly implement one.
