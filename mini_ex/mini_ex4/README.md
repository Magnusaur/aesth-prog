# Privacy? Tell us all about it!
Worried about the increasingly sophisticated subtlety of surveillance? Feeling unsure about the role, nature and possibility of private life in a digital age? Worry not, we are here to help. Simply grant us access to your microphone and confide in us your greatest fears. We'll prevent we didn't already hear everything. [Click here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Magnusaur/aesth-prog/46437c34/mini_ex/mini_ex4/concern_index.html) to begin the conversation. A circular spectogram will be created, beautifully encapsulating your paranoid confession. When you are done, just click the 'submit' button to send your questions and concerns.

## "This place is bugged...!"
For this assignment, I was not only tight on time; I also had some trouble thinking of an interesting design. The idea of venturing into the great unknown of DOM-libraries (and beyond) was daunting, but ultimately I mustered the courage to try out some new functions. And some of it even worked out, too! Because I was now not (just) dealing with rectangles and ellipses, I was less sure about where to go for directions. There's the reference section on the p5 webiste, of course, but that did not quite do the trick. Similarly, Shiffman, although undeniably mythical in his awkward presence, is not quite the Bible when it comes to the many wonders of p5. In the end, I sought out the 'Learning while making p5' video by the virgin mother herself, Lauren McCarthy. Additionally, I prowled the mini_exercise folders of previous ages, looking for guidance on how to implement certain elements. Plagiarism? Pastiche? Capture all! 

Ultiamtely, I did learn a few things about creating functions, using variables and arrays and even microphones. That was pretty wild. The program itself is rather simply. The microphone makes a circle (or several, as the background does not re-draw automatically) and when you want to start over, you can press 'submit'. So I also pulled in a button function from the DOM-library. I like to have a bit of a story to my designs, and for this particular one, I wanted to focus on the paradoxical, contradictory, if not outright ¨¨fucked¨¨ crazy idea of giving someone access to your private live, in order to preserve or protect just that. By the time of submitting this, I feel a lot better than before I a couple of hours ago. Can coding - or learning new things - be therapeutic? A question for another time!

## You know how to push the right buttons
We like buttons. We like to press them. We may even desire to press them, knowing full well that it will do nothing. I sometimes tap away on my keyboard, even when the computer is turned off. Similarly, while digital buttons - buttons on digital interfaces - have no haptic element to them, they are still pleasant to click. The physical nature of the mouse button is of course related, but I am still inclined to think that we would prefer a nicely animated, responsive button over a more phony looking one. Even if both are purely digital in nature. I wanted buttons to be a part of my design for this reason. The standard button is rather generic, but it will do. Next time, perhaps, I will make my own. It will be colorful and extremly gratifying to press. 

You just wait and see.
