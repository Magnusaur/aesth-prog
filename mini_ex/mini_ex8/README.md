# Wish You Were Here
Spring is finally here. Here to stay? We'll have to wait and see. To commemorate the event, I made the API equivalent to 'Hello World' - a program based on weather data! [Click here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Magnusaur/aesth-prog/df88f3c5/mini_ex/mini_ex8/weather_index.html) to check a look.

## It's always sunny on Gran Canaria
API's (with or without the apostrophe? Make up your mind!) are incredibly interesting... things, artefacts, entities, quasi-objects or whatever you want to call them. This week we were tasked with teaming up in teams of two and creating a program utilizing the secret API-sauce. Unfortunately, this week I was also tasked with Secret & Serious Family Business, and so I was short on both time and disposable team-mates. As such, I had to go it alone (Never Go It Alone) and the results are accordingly humble. I drew a couple of rectangles which by the human eye, ever eager to see patterns where none exist, may be perceived as a sunny beach. The size of the sun is dependent on the temperature readings in Mog√°n - a hyperreal "city" on Gran Canaria that I recently visited. Admitedly, it is not terribly exciting to look at, but that won't stop me from attach some my trademark "clever comments" on the project as a whole.

## The Nice and Accurate Reflections of Magnus Laursen, Hackfraud
'API' means 'Application Programming Interface'. 'Application Programming Interface' means 'Thing between two machines that you can talk to'. With API's come the access to a bunch of data. Not all data, necesarrily, but more than you can shake a stick at. Data that could be used in statistics, perhaps. Or in third-party applications. Getting access to the data may prove to be a challenge in itself. Another challenge is this: what are you going to do with all that data? Looking at my program, it is perhaps obvious that I heavily, uh, consulted Daniel Shiffman (it being obvious because so did everyone else, suckers!). The first things he remarks is that "we used to do it one way, but these days it's different". The temporal and dynamic aspect of API's is immediately made clear: you cannot trust API's to stay or work the same. Changes, whether technical or political ("The two are alike!", I can hear someone screaming) are bound to happen. It is that very same "dynamism" of the API that make them attratice, but also risky to use. That's interesting. Same thing with anything else dependant on the internet and a constant flow of information. A chance at life, the certainty of death. As such, in a year from now, this particular mini exercise is the one most likely to have been made obsolete.

As for the actual program in question, I find it interesting how something neat looking (flashy graphics and such) may have been incredibly easy to make. With p5, you can make a serious of glowy bubbles with just a few lines of code. Conversely, something incredibly complex, like an API-harvesting system, may look like crap but actually be the result of many, many hours of hard work. Of course, jt does not have to be either or, but with limited time, resources and scope of project, it is understandable that some of the submitted projects may appear a little simplistic - when in reality, they are anything but. I feel like there is an interesting comparison to natural languages to be made here, but I am not sure what I want to say. Comparing a book to a program, from the viewpoint of a layman (a user). In the former case, the layman is still presented to all the text and sentences that collectively make up the book. With code, one is looking at the result of that code. Looking at my sunny beach, it all appears rather simplistic. And it is, in a sense. But is also a dynamically changing piece of whatever-work that turns and twists according to the temperature on Gran Canaria. In the case of code, one rarely has access to or understanding of the gears and cogs behind the scenes. This is looking a code and text as "products", and not at their inherent properties. In a way, a program (and the code powering it) seems more reletable to a movie, than a book. A terribly exciting discussing that is not at all related to API's.

## There and Back Again
I wanted to use the various weather data to affect the program in interesting ways. As is, the sun is related to the temperature, and the opacity of the blue tint is related to humidity. Oh the humidity! It's not terribly elegant, sure, but it is an interesting challenge nonetheless: to gather data from some natural (or supernatural or paranormal) phenomena and then work that data back into a program, re-representing it again to viewers or users. A discussion semiotic in nature may take place here: how should we (re)present heat? Humidity? Wind? Pollution, death, war and famine? And how strange is it that we (in this case, I) are creating artifical "environments" that not only mimick the behavior of the world, but is also greatly in<i>formed</i> by it. It reminds me of the famous thought-experiement by Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom, regarding the Matrix and the unpleasant probability of living in one...
