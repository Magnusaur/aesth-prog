# Wish You Were Here
Spring is finally here. Here to stay? We'll have to wait and see. To commemorate the event, I made the API equivalent to 'Hello World' - a program based on weather data! [Click here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Magnusaur/aesth-prog/df88f3c5/mini_ex/mini_ex8/weather_index.html) to check a look.

## It's always sunny on Gran Canaria
API's (with or without the apostrophe? Make up your mind!) are incredibly interesting... things, artefacts, entities, quasi-objects or whatever you want to call them. This week we were tasked with teaming up in teams of two and creating a program utilizing the secret API-sauce. Unfortunately, this week I was also tasked with Secret & Serious Family Business, and so I was short on both time and disposable team-mates. As such, I had to go it alone (Never Go It Alone) and the results are accordingly humble. I drew a couple of rectangles which by the human eye, ever eager to see patterns where none exist, may be perceived as a sunny beach. The size of the sun is dependent on the temperature readings in Mog√°n - a hyperreal "city" on Gran Canaria that I recently visited. Admitedly, it is not terribly exciting to look at, but that won't stop me from attach some my trademark "clever comments" on the project as a whole.

## The Nice and Accurate Reflections of Magnus Laursen, Hackfraud
'API' means 'Application Programming Interface'. 'Application Programming Interface' means 'Thing between two machines that you can talk to'. With API's come the access to a bunch of data. Not all data, necesarrily, but more than you can shake a stick at. Data that could be used in statistics, perhaps. Or in third-party applications. Getting access to the data may prove to be a challenge in itself. Another challenge is this: what are you going to do with all that data? Looking at my program, it is perhaps obvious that I heavily, uh, consulted Daniel Shiffman (it being obvious because so did everyone else, suckers!). The first things he remarks is that "we used to do it one way, but these days it's different". The temporal and dynamic aspect of API's is immediately made clear: you cannot trust API's to stay or work the same. Changes, whether technical or political ("The two are alike!", I can hear someone screaming) are bound to happen. It is that very same "dynamism" of the API that make them attratice, but also risky to use. That's interesting. Same thing with anything else dependant on the internet and a constant flow of information. A chance at life, the certainty of death. As such, in a year from now, this particular mini exercise is the one most likely to have been made obsolete.
