# (De)Generative Art

All ends in entropy. The heat death of the universe will consume all life. Nothing lasts forever, especially not that framerate of yours. Watch it falter [here.](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Magnusaur/aesth-prog/ada62d6d/mini_ex/mini_ex6/entropy_index.html)

## The whole is other than the parts
We were asked to create something through generativity. What exactly is generativity? What isn't? Answering, or at least thinking about those questions turned out to be more challenging than the code itself. I wanted to keep things simple. The generative code had to be governed by three rules. They are:
1. The ellipses on the screen must move at random.
2. When one ellipse touches the borders of the screen, another is added.
3. The color of the ellipses is determined at random.
So, quite a bit of randomness in this code. There's a degree of arbitrariness as to what does or does not constitute a rule. Even so, while the actual code is rather simple, I think it's a nice framework for expanding on. It would be quite easy to change what happens, when a circle touches the boundary of the canvas. Or the shape and size of the objects on the screen. I borrowed quite a bit of my "own" code, frem the previous week's exercise. As for the code itself, I made the decision to have the circles instances of classes. I could have achieved something similar (or identical, even?) without, but I want(ed) to implement objects/classes in my work, going forward. It seems like a good idea to maintain that particular skill or syntax.

## Build to last
So far, we have been talking about generative art. Art is something nice and pleasant and easy-going, right? Well, not necessarily. I wanted to create something that seems fun and harmless and first, but gradully gets more complicated and intimidating. Not only do the increasing number of circles clutter the screen in greyscale colors, it also eats up a bunch of memory (or whatever). The computer suffers, at least per analogy, as the program gets increasingly more messy and unwieldy. It's like cancer, rampantly expanding and increasing. We apparently so desire more nuance in the world, but eventually it all turns into a blurry mess. We need some kind of structure, a stroke to separate entities from another, even if they really are all connected. 

Or whatever.
