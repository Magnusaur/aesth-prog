# A Fun Drawing
This week's task was to create something fun(ny) through the use of simple shapes. Check out my [interactive smiley](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Magnusaur/aesth-prog/566d5490/mini_ex/mini_ex2/p5/empty-example/index.html). You can click and move the mouth and nose and the eyes will follow you around.

## Beginnings
Originally, I had something a little more abstract in mind for this exercise. I changed my mind, however, wanting to stick to the concept of the simple, easily identifiable shapes. The result is a smiley face that you can manipulate to a degree. He's pretty happy looking, right? In truth, working out the code for this project was a case of trial-and-error, but also moments of clarity and revelation. During the past week, I had my first coding-related thought in the shower. That's progress. Ultimately, though, I ended up watching the appointed Shiffman videos after finishing most of the code. As such, I discovered many different (and superior) ways of achieving the same result(s). I am not being too hard on myself, however, as discovering certain functions on my own proved to be challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. In comparing coding to natural languages, there is a similar sense of maybe-if-I-do-this-it-will-work. With natural languages, you may attempt to create a new word, but adding two words together. Sometimes it works out. Similarly, being able to create conditions like (mouseX<300) gave me not only a feeling of mastery (hah!), but also of a kind of valuable insight into the internal logic of the entire system. I suspect p5 is very helpful in this way, immediately recognizing certain symbols or words in relation to each other. I imagine expanding this kind of natural language vocabulary might greatly allow the degree of creative control. And that's what variables are for, right?

## Of Mice and Mouths
In creating this project I ran into a bunch of problems and perceived shortcomings. How do I create an object? How exactly must I formulate Boolean if-else conditionals? What's the exact value of creating variables and how do I make the most of them? As mentioned previously I later found answers to these questions, but while it lasted, I did enjoy wrestling with these questions myself. That's not to say that I would do it again. There's obviously an abundance of knowledge to draw upon with regards to programming and I better make the best of it. One interesting problem I came across was this: I wanted the mouth to be manipulable. I did not know how to define the mouth as an object, however. I knew that I could tie the dimensions of the mouth to the values of the X and Y-position of the mouse. But I wanted to ensure some kind of spatial proximity between the mouse and the mouth. So I had to specify the required coordinates in conjunction with the mouse-click. However, this created an unforseen problem: the mouth could now only be manipulated within those conditional dimensions. In hindsight it seems obvious - move the mouse out of range, and the mouth cannot follow - but it was a bit of surprise when I realized this.

## Let's put a smile on that face
Olga Goriunova writes: "Fun should not be understood correctly or in one way: its strength is in its multiplicity." I tend to agree. Even so, I went with something near universal in its appeal and meaning: the smiley. Adorable, inoffensive, expressive. In terms of interaction, I think there's a rather unique kind of fun related to the sense of manipulating objects - even to the point where they are not behaving as intended by the creator. This is beautifully illustrated by the intro-screen in Super Mario 64, which this project humbly pays homage to. With regards to fun in code, there is obviously the experience of coding itself. I did not use the word once in the previous sections, but I would not object to someone descriping this exploratory experience as fun. Furthermore, I found the (proposed) connection between fun, wit and economy. "Brevity is the soul of wit", someone said. It was Shakespeare, but that's not important. What's important is the idea, that making the most of very little is not only efficient; it's witty. That kind of economical thinking makes for good jokes (cut away the fat, they say) and good code. Learning about variables definitely made me appreciate this to a greater extend. It allows for a coding proces (and product) that is more tightly organized, but manageable and, well, more fun.

Speaking of brevity, I think I better stop writing now.
