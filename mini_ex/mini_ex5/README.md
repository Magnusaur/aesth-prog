# Cool stuff goes here
The damn globalists are at it again! Frogs are everywhere and only Alex Jones, nutcase <i>extraordinaire</i> can stop them! Push the button to create new frogs - then fire at will to send 'em back to frog-hell! Don't forget to enable sound. Keep the volume down, though. The beat is damn catchy, but Alex' is notoriously loud-mouthed. [Check a look!](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Magnusaur/aesth-prog/8a132922/mini_ex/mini_ex5/scum_index.html)

## FROAARKS
This exercise was an emotional roller coaster. Ever since the beginning of the course, I have been wanting to learn about objects. It seemed like an equally important and natural step 

## An unwarranted digression
Conceptually, objects make a lot of sense to me. In some way, their existence harken back to what is known as the 'Medieval Problem of Universals'. In truth though, discussions about the relationship between classes (or categories) and their members (or in this case, instances) can be traced back to Ancient Greece. The problem - or was, as it is sometimes also referred as - goes something like this: what is the nature of categories? Do they exist prior to any members? Or do we create them, after the fact? Is there some kind of metaphysical blueprint, from which all chairs are derived - or do we simply look at a bunch of chairs, make some abstractions and then retroactively consider that a category of sorts? It's not within the scope of this... whatever this is, to fully address those questions, but I find them interesting and - at least by some stretch of imagination (or association, perhaps) - relevant to this course. Object-Oriented Programming, if nothing else, takes a stance on the discussion: classes precede individual instances.

## Modularity & Reusability
This project is to date my most ambitious. Maybe that doesn't tell you much, but it really was. I was adamant about figuring out key parts of the code on my own (to the degree that looking at references and other people's project can be considered a work of solitude). I am going to be using classes a lot going forward, so I wanted to learn it by heart. Ultimately, my project is not much different from what you might find in a Shiffman-video, but it was a labor of love and one I had quite a bit of fun with.
