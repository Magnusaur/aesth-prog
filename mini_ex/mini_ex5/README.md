# Frog Blaster 3000!
The damn globalists are at it again! Frogs are spreading all over the place and only Alex Jones, conspiratory nutcase <i>extraordinaire</i> can stop them! Push the button to create new frogs - then fire at will to send 'em back to swamp-hell! Don't forget to enable sound. Keep the volume down, though. The beat is damn catchy, but Alex' is notoriously loud-mouthed. [Check a look!](https://ghcdn.rawgit.org/Magnusaur/aesth-prog/master/mini_ex/mini_ex5/scum_index.html)

## FROAARKS
This exercise was an emotional roller coaster. Ever since the beginning of the course, I have been wanting to learn about objects. The limitations of simply using 'draw' and 'setup' has become increasingly apparent to me. As such, learning to create objects seemed like an equally important and interesting aspect of coding. I imagine(d) that creating objects would become a standard method going forward, and as such it was paramount that I actually learned to create them from scratch - and by heart. Of course, there is a limit to just how much you can figure out on your own (especially if you want to make the best use of your time), but I managed to do a lot by simply experimenting. Creating a multi-component object (the head, the eyes, the pupils) was troublesome, but I found it quite rewarding to make it all work. To the degree that it does work. In generating the frogs, I also made some important realizations regarding the relation between 'draw' and other functions. The twitchy frog-mouth is a result of this discovery. While I eventually figured out how to fix it, but I let it stay that way. The twitchiness had grown on me.

## Froggy
I was really excited about the prospect of having to create a game-like program. I quickly zeroed in on the concept. Intuitively, this kind of 'randomly moving shooting gallery' seemed like the right mix between the challenging and the familiar. Numerous times, especially towards the end where an unsubordiante splice-function was driving me mad, I wanted to give up and just turn upload what little I had. I perservered, however, and it's a good thing I did. As for the imagery used, I have a long-lasting fascination with the man that is Alex Jones. And frogs are interesting animals, statistically overrepresented in memes, metaphors and stories. I wanted the frogs to be kind of funny-looking, but also somewhat cute. The sound effects hopefully gives the experience an extra bit of spice. Hopefully the drive the point (whatever that is) hope and further highlight the absurdity of the entire premise.

## An unwarranted digression
Conceptually, objects make a lot of sense to me. In some way, their existence harken back to what is known as the 'Medieval Problem of Universals'. In truth though, discussions about the relationship between classes (or categories (or Forms)) and their members (or in this case, instances) can be traced back to Ancient Greece. The problem - or war, as it is sometimes also referred as - goes something like this: what is the nature of categories? Do they exist prior to the members comprising those classes? Or do we create them, after the fact? Is there some kind of metaphysical blueprint, from which all chairs are derived - or do we simply look at a bunch of chairs, make some abstractions and then retroactively consider that a category of sorts? It's not within the scope of this... whatever this is, to fully address those questions, but I find them interesting and - at least by some stretch of imagination (or association, perhaps) - relevant to this course. Object-Oriented Programming, if nothing else, takes a stance on the discussion: classes precede individual instances. You need the cookie-cutter, before you can create the cookie.

## Some kind of game
This project is to date my most amphibious. Wait, ambitious. Maybe that doesn't say much, but it really was. I was adamant about figuring out key parts of the code on my own (to the degree that looking at references and other people's project can be considered a work of solitude). Ultimately, my project is not much different from what you might find in a Shiffman-video, but it was a labor of love and one I had quite a bit of fun with. It's basically some kind of shooting gallery, in which the player gets to not only destroy the enemies, but also dictate their creation as well. The frogs all look a little different. Some are bigger and thus easier to hit. A lot of major video game titles have been using a degree of procedurality in creating their enemies. A popular example is Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. In that game, the orc-enemies all look different and they have different qualities, strengths and weaknesses. The process creating the orcs is obviously much more complex than what I created, yet their characteristics can still be roughly grouped into two: attributes and methods. I did not reflect deeply on this particular aspect of the code, but let it be said that the use of procedurally generated enemies (or other elements), while perhaps initially controversial ("oh, so you just made one enemy-type, but in different colors!") can make for interesting and dynamically created situations ("whoa, only huge frogs are spawning right now!").

## Modularity & Reusability
As I mentioned previously in this overlong... thing, I have come to see some of the limitations of only using 'draw' and 'setup'. First of all, it gets cluttered and difficult to manage. Furthermore, reusing the same pieces of code quickly gets cumbersome. Using objects - as well as custom functions - create powerful opportunities to segment and 'modularize'. Still, new opportunities can also create new issues. At least in the beginning. As such I had some problems figuring out what aspects of the Frog-class should be put in 'draw' and what functions should even be a part of the class or stand on their own. Is it a fundamental part of the frog that it can be aimed at and shot? Or is it something more universal? De facto, it seems to come down to the use of variables - local or global.

That's all for now. *Croak*
