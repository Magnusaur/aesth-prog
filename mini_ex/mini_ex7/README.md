Calling all monkeys! The collected works of the great William Shakespeare has been lost in a recent blackout and it falls to a bunch of persistent primates to recreate his oeuvre. For your enduring service, you will be repaid handsomely in bananas. What are the odds of success? How will you even know when you are done? Quit asking difficult questions, you dumb ape! All you need is eternity, immortality, and the willpower to put those stinking paws of yours to good use.

## Infinite Monkey Theorem
This project was a lot of fun. I think it's safe to say that Martin and I are both very happy with the outcome. Perhaps more importantly, the program could easily be improved on in numerous ways. We set out to create something highly conceptual - drawing on the famous 'monkeys using typewriters' idea: given enough time (preferably, eternity) one or multiple monkey(s) (doesn't really matter, given eternity) hammering away on a typewriter will manage to type out every single piece of known literature. And really, every single piece of unknown literature, as well. How's that for authorship? This is an abstract thought-experiment that is equally charming and disturbing. The implication is that given eternity, everything will happen. Eternally, even. It makes all of our wonderful works of art, like that of Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i> seem so much more precious... yet also strangely arbitrary. With the monkeys, only blind chance and brute force is governing their actions. We do not ascribe agency or artful precision to our evolutionary cousins. The question is, to what degree should we ascribe that to ourselves? Could such works of art - or perhaps a more crude, but nonetheless coherent piece of literature come about, seemingly by accident or mere chance? We do not have access to neither eternity nor immortal chimps, but what we do have is computers. Computers with the potential to assimilate, amalgate and create "stories" (pardon the scare-quotes) with varying, but increasing, degrees of success.

Anyway, this was the impetus for our project. The monkey-theorem is old (arguably ancient, even), but it has never been more easily demonstrated. As such, we wanted to take a relatively familar idea and embody it in technology. Of course, there is some sleight of hand involved, but principally we did create the framework for someone to endless type and type and type until the words of the legendary soliloquy are correctly placed and positioned. Now, if only we had one of those industrious monkeys lying around... 

## Heavy Meta
As a concept, we relatively quickled settled on the nature and 'purpose' of the project. We knew what it would be like as a <i>product</i>, you might say. As a <i>process</i>, however... We created the project over the course of two sessions: one where we met in the flesh, the other through online communcation. In both cases, we made use of the 'teletype' module for Atom. This allowed us to work on the same body of code, simultaneously. In reality though, we had to make adjustments. Only the host can actually run the code, whereas teletype 'guests' can only edit or modify it. As such, we had to create duplicates for experimentation. I, as the guest, would reguarly copy the master-source into my own JS-file, run it, modify it and then apply those changes to the original. Martin, hosting the teletype-session, would likewise create his own private version of the code. With great cooperation comes great risk of fucking things up, and neither of us wanted to ruin the 'pristine' master-source. So there was an interesting bit of back-and-forth, as we experienced the essential GitHub push/pull dynamic in real-time. It allowed for a clearer degree of communcation, but not without certain pitfalls. During online voice-communication, I would ask Martin to comment on certain changes - and then realize that I was typing away in my own local Atom-tab, not the one being shared through teletyping. Similarly, introducing sounds and images as variables in the master required both of us to actually have access to the various types of media-files.

Perhaps none of this is terribly exciting to read about. But it did engender a sense of working on a 'real project', as opposed to hacking away on your own private string of code that no one is really going to look at. Unconsciously, I think both of us wanted to adhere to functions and commands that were (are) at this point, familiar to everyone involved. Meaning both of us. It needed to be legible to the other part, lest one of us mistake the importance or role of some particular line of code and then start tampering with it. So the process was interesting and different. Broadly speaking, the types of challenges we faced can be split into two categories: 
1) This new snappy function could be super useful and elegant but we don't really know how it works,
2) This thing is pretty straight-forward, but kind of dull and time consuming.

Case in point, the split-string-array function was incredibly useful and very elegant. Until it did not work as intended and we found ourselves blackboxed by our own design. Conversely, the excess of if-statements and text strings is nasty, brutish and quite long to look at, but gets the job done with little to no risk of failure. It was particularly during the former type of challenges that we experienced frustration, anxiety, despair and eventual relief. And it was on one such occasion that Martin brilliantly remarked how this whole monkeys-on-typewriters concept was becoming all too real and all too relatable. After all, if you can replace the typewriter with a keyboard and the point still stands: given eternity, the monkey(s) will create everything, including this program. Still, those dumb apes need eternity to get there - we did it in a week!
